A tech enthusiast, a film lover, and a Youtube binge watcher. Used to be a traveler as well but have been paused during the pandemic. I have studied in 4 different regions, now growing up in Singapore.

While working full-time, I am also a Master of IT in Business degree candidate at Singapore Management University, pursuing Analytics Track.

I have solid experience in sensing different trends in Asia, along with sharp analytical eyes to the market. As a product planner in the tech industry, my area of focus varies from tech trends, media, and content, where I do both extensive research as well as liaise with different stakeholders.
