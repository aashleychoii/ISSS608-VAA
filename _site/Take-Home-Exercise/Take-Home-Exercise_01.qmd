## **Hi! Welcome to my first take-home exercise.**

Let's explore Singapore's demographics by age, sex, and planning areas. For this task, I used Tableau to create an age-sex pyramid to visualize Singapore's demographic structure.

**The Data**

Singapore's data main-body, Singstat, regularly releases its latest demographics data on its website. You may refer to this data for this task: Singapore Residents by Planning Area / Subzone, Age Group, Sex and Type of Dwelling, June 2022.

**Step-by-Step Guide**

Tableau is a great tool to intuitively craft visual analytics chart.
